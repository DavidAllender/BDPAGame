Every year for a few months in the late winter/early spring, I teach high school kids JavaScript. This repo contains a very basic space game that I threw together to show them some of the more advanced things that can be done in the browser. This app uses Crafty.js as a game engine/animation library. 

This repo does not necessarily represent the best way to do things. It's just what I was able to hack together over about ten hours worth of work spread out over many weeknights. Best practices are not followed, and most game features are barely functional. I don't even know if anything will render in your browser. I'm not going to worry about it.
